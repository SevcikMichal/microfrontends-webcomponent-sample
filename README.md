# Microfrontends WebComponent Sample

This repository contains a sample microfrontend application that uses web components. It serves as an example of how to use web components to create a microfrontend application. The main goal is to provide a working example that can be used to showcase the microfrontends-controller: https://github.com/SevcikMichal/microfrontends-controller.

The microfrontends-controller repository contains some examples, but none of them have a complete UI + backend package. The controller can be used in combination with the microfrontends-webui: https://github.com/SevcikMichal/microfrontends-webui.

By combining all three projects, you will have the running infrastructure to deploy microfrontend applications using Kubernetes custom resources WebComponents, and a working example web UI where you can see your deployed web component.
